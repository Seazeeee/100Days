# Addition

3 + 5 | *Integer*

# Subtraction

1 - 7 | *Integer*

# Multiplication 

1 * 7 | *Integer*

# Division

1 / 7 | Division always becomes a *float*

# Exponent

2 ** 2 | 2 to the power of 2


Don't forget that Python follows the order of operations ( PEMDAS )

PEMDAS - Order things happens

()
**
* / - Prioritizes the most-left operation
+ - - Prioritizes the most-left operation


3 * 3 + 3 / 3 - 3
-------------------

9 + 1 - 3 

10 - 3

= 7.0

# Round

instead of int use round 

# Floor Division 

// - Chops off all of the decimals while converting it into an integer
