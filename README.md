# 100Days

This is a project for myself to become a developer. I started school as a CS
Major and found that I was unable to finish. This is a test to trying again.

### Plan

I want to document my progress and notes and use this README as a way to keep
myself accountable.

Here to Hoping!

# Updates

### 5/29/24
- I have chosen to make this repo public so that people can view this. I have found that 
my notes may be helpful and it also shows the progression of my code. This has been one 
of the intriguing and fun challenges I have brought upon myself. Heres to another 13 days!

### 6/3/24
- Progress is slowing down but I am try to make sure I ingest something at least once a
day. Hopefully I can pick that pace back up and start my other course at day 20 which will
deal with mySQL. I will be creating another repo that houses that information and progress
as well to slowly build up my GitHub Profile. Just mentally pushing forward are you have 
too.

### 6/18/24
- Progress has slowed sown tremendously with the start of summer classes. However, I am still
focusing on trying to at least open up VSCode everyday and right something. I have also started
mySQL which is taking up more of my time. Im going to keep pushing myself forward because I
believe I am improving on all my skills. Hopeful to have a better resume by the end of the summer.
