# 100Days

This is a project for myself to become a developer. I started school as a CS
Major and found that I was unable to finish. This is a test to trying again.

### Plan

I want to document my progress and notes and use this README as a way to keep
myself accountable.

Here to Hoping!

- I have chosen to make this repo public so that people can view this. I have found that 
my notes may be helpful and it also shows the progression of my code. This has been one 
of the intriguing and fun challenges I have brought upon myself. Heres to another 13 days!
